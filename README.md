# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project#

## Introduction ##

Here is my course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".

## The Data Set ##

The data represents data collected from the accelerators from the Samsung Galaxy S smart phone. You can get the dataset here: [Smart Phone Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

Read the readme.txt to learn about the data.

## About run_analysis.R script ##

Prerequisites to run this script:

1. UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted 
2. UCI HAR Dataset must be available in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

run_analysis.R merges the test and training sets together and cleans the data. Finally a tidy data set is created 

## The Tidy Data Set ##

tidy_data.txt contains the aggregated data from the original data set.


## About the Code Book ##

The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
